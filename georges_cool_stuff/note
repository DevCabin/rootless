2.11.14

http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/getting-started/including-acf-in-a-plugin-theme/
Added to theme! It's legal, just get it right, see about including their 
options under our options.


===============================
NOTE: Need to @import or whatever you do to get the latest of these rather than
this static "put em in the folder" business - backstretch has a grunt file

ADD THIS: http://www.armagost.com/blog/developing-a-content-slider-with-custom-post-types/
Custom post type for sliders!

-- Add full width option for big screens to sass

1.2.14

Ok so...

==============
SLIDERS
==============

Here's the one I used in production: http://startbootstrap.com/half-slider 
(lot's of great stuff in there)
Default BootStrap slider docs here: http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel

bxslider is simple and lightweight - AND for html, vid OR images
URL: http://bxslider.com/faqs
License: The bxSlider is released under the WTFPL license - http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/ 

Flux slider has killer transitions, BUT is ONLY FOR IMAGES

LIGHTBOXES
==============

As far as lightboxes go...
ekko-lightbox.js is already included in my new roots. It uses stuff already in bootstrap, 
with just a little bit added.
URL: https://github.com/ashleydw/lightbox
License: https://github.com/ashleydw/lightbox/blob/master/LICENSE.txt (GNU v2)

but here's an alt if you need it...
prettyPhoto v3.1.4
URL: http://www.no-margin-for-errors.com/projects/prettyPhoto/
License: “prettyPhoto is totally free to use, it is released the GPLv2 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) or Creative Commons 2.5 license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/). Feel free to use the one that suits your needs. You can use it in all you projects even commercial ones as long as you leave the credits at the top intact. ”

And finally, a super simple lightbox that is totally totally free to use.
https://travis-ci.org/cocopon/vanillabox.png?branch=master

Free for commercial use.

NOTE: Has notes for sass/less terminal usage :)

==============
IMAGE LOAGING
==============
http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload 
-- ADDED to vendor js folder, but not yet enqueued

Then we have this: http://luis-almeida.github.io/unveil/
based on lazyload (above) but removes certain features and weighs
in at less than 1k !!
Not including at this time, just make note. 

And a final alternative: 
http://toddmotto.com/labs/echo/
Seems really easy to implement, but may have issues. 

PHP and js solution - 
http://adaptive-images.com/
- hang on to this, but I don't think it's ripe enough for mainstream production.
